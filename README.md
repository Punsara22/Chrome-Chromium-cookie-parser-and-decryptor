# Explanation

Chromium-based browser store cookies in an encrypted SQLite database in file named `Cookie`. File path depends on browser version. Here are some examples.

- On Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies` (encrypted with DPAPI â€” Windows Data Protection API). Old versions below 2022 used path `...\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cookies`.
- On macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies` (protected by TCC).

Chromium cookies DB has 2 columns for storing values: `value` and `encrypted_value`, the latter one being used when the cookie stored was requested to be encrypted with Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI). Often the case with certain confidential information and long-time session keys. Chromium uses triple DES encryption with the current users password as seed on windows machines. In order to decrypt this in C#, you should use DPAPI, otherwise you can't decrypt your cookie file cause of wrong masterkey.

So the steps are:
1. Access the cookie database and the encryption key (e.g., the AES key in the `Local State` file on Windows which is located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\`).
2. Decrypt the AES key using DPAPI or get the DPAPI Master Key from `C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect` (google about `CREDHIST` / `SYNCHIST` and their value in the OS).

DPAPI ties encryption to the **user profile and machine**, so you need to decrypt AES key on the same machine where it was encoded.
